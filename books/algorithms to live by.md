## Chapter 3: Sorting
- pg 61: "one of the main reasons things get sorted is to be shown in useful form to human eyes"
- pg 72: "But if you actually asked a computer scientist to help implement this process, the first question they would ask is whether you should be sorting at all." 
- pg 73: "As the cost of searching drops, sorting becomes less valuable."
