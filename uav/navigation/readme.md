## 2018-10 P-CAP Pre-computed Alternative Paths to Enable Aggressive Aerial Maneuvers in Cluttered Environments
- "We suggest that computation needed to find safe paths during fast flight can be greatly reduced if we precompute and carefully arrange a dense set of alternative paths before the flight. Any prior map information can be used to prune the alternative paths"
